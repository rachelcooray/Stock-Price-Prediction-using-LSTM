# LSTM-Based Stock Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for stock price prediction using historical data. The goal is to leverage the temporal dependencies in sequential data to forecast stock prices for algorithmic trading.

The model is designed to predict the stock's closing price based on historical price trends, offering a practical approach to time-series forecasting in the financial domain.
